        <description lang="en">Moonlight (formerly known as Limelight) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol. We implemented the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield and wrote a set of 3rd party clients.

        What does this mean for you? Moonlight allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from your GFE compatible PC to any of your supported devices and play them. Right now, you can stream to your Android device or even another PC. Moonlight is perfect for gameplay on the go without sacrificing the graphics quality of your gaming computer.</description>
